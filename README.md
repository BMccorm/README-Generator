## Description

This command-line application dynamically creates README files based off of the user's input. It was created using Node.js and Javascript. This file is an example of what it builds.

## Installation

To install this project, fork the repo and download all node module packages, including Inquirer. Open the folder in terminal and enter "node index.js".

## Commonly Asked Questions

**Can this file be updated once generated by the app?**
